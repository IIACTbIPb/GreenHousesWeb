Multiplayers game
***************************************************
The site was launched using the Open Server program
****************************************************
It is necessary to import the database located in the "sql data base" folder. Database access configuration is in the "db.php" file
****************************************************

The site logic is written in JavaScript + php, the interactive part is in js, data transfer to the database is in php. 
Was it done for the purpose of learning interaction, or I just didn't know Node.js yet =)
